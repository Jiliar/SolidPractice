## Single Responsability:

This principle establishes that a component or class must have a simple, single and concrete responsability.<br/>
This simplifies code by avoiding the existence of classes that fulfill with several functions, wich are difficult to<br/>
memorize and often waste time looking for wich part of code does witch function.<br/>
A class should have only a reason to change, that is to say classes should have a high cohesion.
