## Dependency Inversion:

This principle allow creating applications more flexible, that's to say, applications that we can extend easily.<br/>
The entities must depend on abstractions and not concretions. This definition establishes that a high level module <br/>
shouldn't depend on a low level module, else it must depend on abstractions.<br/>
