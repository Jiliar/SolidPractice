# 🚀 SolidPractice

This project demonstrates practical applications of **SOLID Principles** in Java, complete with diagrams for clear understanding! 💡

### 📌 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class has **one specific responsibility**. This keeps the code organized, easy to maintain, and avoids classes with multiple unrelated functions.

### 📌 Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Classes should be **open for extension but closed for modification**, achievable with inheritance and polymorphism.

### 📌 Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Subtypes should be **substitutable for their base types** without altering the program’s correctness.

### 📌 Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Interfaces should be **specific to client requirements**, preventing “fat” interfaces and enforcing only relevant methods.

### 📌 Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should **depend on abstractions, not details**, creating a flexible and extendable code structure.
