Interfaces Segregation Principle

Clients should never be forced to depend on methods that not use. Always after create
interfaces to define behaviors, we must be sure that the classes which implements
interfaces use all methods, on the other hand we should create interfaces a little less complex
to avoid fat interfaces.
