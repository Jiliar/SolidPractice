Single Responsability Principle:

This principle establishes that a component or class must have a simple, single and concrete responsability.
This simplifies code by avoiding the existence of classes that fulfuill with several funtions, wich are difficult to
memorize and often waste time looking for wich part of code does witch function.

A class should have only a reason to change, that is to say classes should have a high cohesion.
